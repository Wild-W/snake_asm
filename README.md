# Snake written in x86-64 with NASM

Or at least it will be soon.

## Why does the code suck?

I've never built software in assembly before. In addition, x86-64 isn't very human friendly in comparison to simpler architectures.

## So why build it in x86-64?

To become more familiar with the architecture so I am better at reverse engineering 64-bit applications.
